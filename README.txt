Just a little Wolfram script I made to access wolfram from the python command line.'

How to use:

If you have an App ID from Wolfram, you can update the script where it says "app_id" and input your own. If not, mine is the default ID. 

Once running you'll be prompted by:

"Enter Query: "

You can enter anything you'd like and it will spit out the answer direct from Wolfram.


Examples:

App ID:  APLTT9-9WG78GYE65
Enter Query: how old is earth
age of the Earth
4.54 billion years
1.43×10^17 seconds
 ~~ 0.33 × universe age (~~ 14 Gyr )
 ~~ 0.45 × expected lifetime of the sun (~~ 10 billion yr )
 ~~ 0.993 × age of the sun (~~ 4.57 billion yr )
eon
Precambrian (Hadean)


App ID:  APLTT9-9WG78GYE65
Enter Query: derivative of x^2
d/dx(x^2) = 2 x
line
R  (all real numbers)
R  (all real numbers)
odd
 integral 2 x dx = x^2+constant
